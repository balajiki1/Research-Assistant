    "question": "Compare reinforcement learning and supervised learning in terms of data requirements.",
    "answer": "Reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised learning differ significantly in their data requirements. Supervised learning relies on pre-existing, labeled datasets to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs [2]. In contrast, reinforcement learning learns through trial and error by interacting with an environment, generating its own data as it goes [2]. This fundamental difference leads to a much higher data demand in RL [1, 3].\n\nSeveral factors contribute to RL's data inefficiency. RL algorithms often require extensive exploration to discover optimal policies, leading to vast amounts of generated data [4, 8]. The concept of 'Sample Complexity' highlights that RL algorithms typically need more samples than supervised methods to achieve satisfactory performance [3].\n\nTo address the data scarcity challenge in RL, researchers are exploring various techniques. *Imitation learning* leverages expert demonstrations to guide the learning process, reducing the need for extensive exploration [1, 6]. *Transfer learning* utilizes knowledge gained from related tasks to improve learning efficiency in data-poor environments [1, 5]. *Active learning* focuses on intelligently selecting which experiences to learn from, minimizing the need for exhaustive data collection [1, 4]. Furthermore, *data augmentation* techniques, similar to those used in supervised learning, are being adapted to enhance the performance and robustness of RL algorithms, thus reducing the need for vast amounts of original training data [7]. Different model-free RL algorithms also exhibit varying degrees of sample efficiency based on factors such as exploration strategies and reward function design [8].\n\nIn conclusion, while supervised learning thrives on labeled datasets, reinforcement learning faces the challenge of learning from its own interactions, leading to significantly higher data requirements. Techniques like imitation learning, transfer learning, active learning, and data augmentation are actively being developed to bridge this gap and improve the practicality of RL [1].",
